This is my blog where I post about cybersecurity things, mostly CTI, DFIR and MA/RE.

I'm a cybersecurity analyst working in a SOC doing threat hunting, detection engineering. and incident response. My path into cyber started by doing a BSc in Computer Science I then worked in helpdesk before moving into my first security role as an IDAM engineer. 

My other interests include languages (learning Russian and Norwegian), gardening,  history (studying a BA in History part time), and memeing on twitter.
