## Static Analysis

### File Hashes
I pulled the below hashes using hashcalc.

- MD5: e332b4d019590be2329fd2baf39ae919
- SHA1: 87101ac19007b7c05033694151a28a1560312881
- SHA256: 01e38278ae884c2ebacd3b4ca31e17aa55eb7385b6f23b623d9885ee9bce23e8

### VirusTotal
Of the samples I have looked at so far this is detected by AV the most with 51/66 vendors flagging it as malicious. 

Hopefully this indicates that there are no anti-analysis techniques used and it is a straightforward sample to analyse. There is a lot to go through here but i'd like to go into my manual anaysis blind so lets move on.

VirusTotal - [https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/01e38278ae884c2ebacd3b4ca31e17aa55eb7385b6f23b623d9885ee9bce23e8](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/01e38278ae884c2ebacd3b4ca31e17aa55eb7385b6f23b623d9885ee9bce23e8)

### Strings
I used floss to pull the strings from this sample. 

There is very little here aside from an xml manifest and some Windows dll files. Given the lack of intersting strings I suspect this sample is packed, so much for being easy.

### PEStudio
As soon as I load the sample into PEStudio the signature 'Enigma Protector' jumps out.
