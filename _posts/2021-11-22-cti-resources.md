I am compiling a list of resources I am using myself as I dive into CTI and hope they will be useful for others. This list is by no means authoritative or definitive and is a work in progress as I come across new resources.

This will not include any information on recommended background knowledge, but to get the most out of these resources you should have some familiarity with cybersecurity.
