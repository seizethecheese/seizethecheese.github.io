# TL;DR
- Is it time to go into "High Alert!!"? No.
- Is it time to review IR plans? Yes, but you should be doing that regularly anyway.
- Do I need to patch everything? Yes, but you should be anyway. If this seems overwheming a great place to start is CISA's list of actively exploited vulnerabilities[ยน](link).

# Mid-Long Term Effects
Two things have consistently stuck out to me in all of President Biden's messaging on US actions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The first is not suprising - the unambiguous rejection of any direct US involvment in the conflict; the second is a little less on the nose - there is strong consideration given to potential domestic (both to U.S. and her Allies) effects. The gas issue has been done to death, effects on US and European oil prices is also much discussed, and the new in vogue topic is wheat prices. While all of these are obviously important I think there are second order effects that the sanctions will lead to in the mid-long term that haven't made it into media discourse and the one that is particularly relevant to me is ransomware.

A quick look at the geographic location of cyber crime groups reveals a few distinct hotspots: Iran, North Korea, and Russia.
