# Background
After reviewing a Trend Micro report detailing a Gootkit Loader campaign targeting the Australian healthcare industry [available here](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/23/a/gootkit-loader-actively-targets-the-australian-healthcare-indust.html), I decided to have a look myself and see if I could spot anything interesting.  

Two samples drew my eye right away. 
- [water corporation enterprise agreement 2018 wa 15722.js](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/12d5e2381ec06c03b3dace9eae655ac8d05bc5b82cb0d9f6f68a8bcfa75e84c0)
- [Olympic_dam_enterprise_agreement (qlh).js](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c606703754ef90e65b2a223be654af920b3da321dfca28bcf0679e445a44a0f3)

Obviously concerning.

#SEO Poisoning

I began my analysis by looking for evidence of SEO poisoning as observed in the healthcare targeted campaign described in the Trend Micro report mentioned above. I ran a search on the filename and had a few results from more expected sites but one from a .it domain that looked like what I was for.

Unfortunately, when checking the page there was nothing of interest. At this point I jumped into analysis of the .js file itself.

Later on, while doing some research into other campaigns I skimmed through a SentinelOne report, [available here](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/gootloader-initial-access-as-a-service-platform-expands-its-search-for-high-value-targets/), they mentioned the use of a dummy site. When opening the ibpm.it page with a VPN set up to Australia I find the result I am looking for.

# Malware Analysis

I started off with some static analysis and it was immediately obvious that the javascript was obfuscated. HP Threat Research have published a gootloader deobfuscator tool on [their github](https://github.com/hpthreatresearch), but it did not work in this case as I suspect these samples are a newer version. I played around a bit trying to get it to work with my samples but this is where my time ran out and my son woke up from his nap.

# Conclusion

But as this is targeted towards water infrastructure it's hard to rule out APT Nestle
