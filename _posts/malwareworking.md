## Static Analysis

### File Hashes
I pulled the below hashes using hashcalc.

- MD5: 1b97637fd83abfb7ecab040a4cda2d52
- SHA1: 305b7002b65358a447ec6b49c2059271c48b2517
- SHA256: d71dc7ba8523947e08c6eec43a726fe75aed248dfd3a7c4f6537224e9ed05f6f

### VirusTotal
This was flagged as malicious by ~50% (36/69) of vendors. It also is flagged by 2 Sigma rules, one of the being a rule detecting failed code integrity checks. 

VirusTotal - [https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d71dc7ba8523947e08c6eec43a726fe75aed248dfd3a7c4f6537224e9ed05f6f/summary](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d71dc7ba8523947e08c6eec43a726fe75aed248dfd3a7c4f6537224e9ed05f6f/summary)

### Strings
I used floss to pull the strings from this sample. 

There is very little here aside from an xml manifest and some Windows dll files. Given the lack of intersting strings I suspect this sample is packed, so much for being easy.

### PEStudio
As soon as I load the sample into PEStudio the signature 'Enigma Protector' jumps out.
