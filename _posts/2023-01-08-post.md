# High-Level Technical Summary 


# Malware Composition
The malware sample is comprised of one exe file Ransomware.wannacry.exe.

`SHA256: 24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c`

# Static Analysis

## Strings
There are some interesting strings present in the wannacry sample. The most notable is a URL.

`http://www.iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com`

There is also an icalcs command that would grant full access to every user to all files and folders recursively.

`icacls . /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q`

## Import Address Table
There are a number of imports related to handling files including ReadFile, GetFileSize, CreateFileA & MoveFileExA. WannaCry is likely manipulating files in some way.
Based on imports like InternetOpenA & InternetOpenUrlA the sample appears to make an internet connection. This can be confirmed during the dynamic analysis phase.
The sample appears to be using random numbers somewhere due to the presence of CryptGenRandom in the IAT.

# Dynamic Analysis
## Execution conditions
This sample need to be executed with Administrator rights in order to detonate. It also will not execute when the victim computer is connected to a host running inetsim.
