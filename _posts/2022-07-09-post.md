title: Chinese Election Interference with Russian Characteristics - Active Measures Down Under
permalink: /AMDU
---

## TL;DR

- Law changes in Australia and NZ have affected Chinese influence operations.
- Russian successes (at least perceived successes) have provided the CCP with a viable alternative.
- We have begun to see evidence of this shift in practice in the ANZ region during the 2022 Australia election.

## The Short

Chinese influence operations have been fairly transparent, work by people like Clive Hamilton and Anne-Marie Brady have bought this activity into the public consciousness. This has led to increased media attention and law changes in ANZ curbing some of the most egregious activity for example, as media coverage increased simultaneously and quietly MPs Raymond Huo & Jian Yang were withdrawn from the Labour and National parties in NZ.

### Problem solved right? Maybe not.

Two bears, one cosy and one fancy, swung the 2016 US election should you believe the hype. The Russian interference in the US 2016 election showed that hack and leak operations were a viable alternative to more direct methods. These capabilities take time to develop and mature, keeping that in mind let's fast forward to 2022 and some questionable "leaks".

A couple of news stories dropped via leaks at inopportune times for the Australian Liberal party. The first was a leaked draft security agreement between China and the Solomon Islands that appeared online on March 24th, less than 2 months out from the election. The second was a leak of emails from the Nauru Police, where Australia has an offshore processing centre  for asylum seekers, on May 2nd less than 3 weeks before the election. The timing, content, and other contextual details point to these leaks not being organic. Accepting the premise that the leaks were not organic but were the product of an intelligence service, then look for an explanation based on capability and motive we can quickly narrow the potential source to China.

### But there is bipartisan opposition to Chinese interference!

Yes, however, the Morrison government had been vocal critics of human rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, called for a WTO investigation into the origin of COVID19, and strengthened the AUKUS agreement purchasing nuclear submarines capable of operating in the South China Sea. It would not be an exaggeration to say that bilateral relations between China and Australia were at their worst since the 1980's. Given this I think it would be acceptable to assume that the CCP the preferred winner of the 2022 election would be the Australian Labour Party.

### I'm convinced! CCP interference swung the 2022 Australian Election!!

Not so fast, I think the material effects of these "leaks" was minimal at best. Scott Morrison was already a very unpopular politician (don't look up what happened at the Engadine McDonalds 20/09/1997). The "leaks" were also unlikely to swing voters, anyone concerned with the offshore detention centre policy were unlikely to vote Liberal, similarly voters with security in the Pacific as their top concern were unlikely to vote Labour. Also, while in other countries stirring up the base of a party could help drive voter turnout, voting in Australia is mandatory.

### Then why should we care?

I believe this is just the beginning and as this capability develops Chinese active measures will become more sophisticated and more successful. We are closing in on an election in NZ, likely September 2023, and need to be on the lookout for Chinese election interference with Russian characteristics.

## The Long

I will expand this as time allows.
